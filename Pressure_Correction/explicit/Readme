The execution starts from the main. If you want to make changes, mind the stability criteria for the time step, and also the grid point
inside the cylinder. Grid plotting can be used for that.  Grid and Boundary Conditions are shown below

Boundary Conditions

Left Boundary (u=1,v=0,dp/dx=0)     BOTTOM (du/dy=0 v =0, dp/dy=0)   Right Boundary (du/dx=0, dv/dx=0,p=0)

L_x= length of the domain in x direction
L_y=length of the domain in y direction
Note, that i use matlab convention. so u(imax,jmax) in cartesian coordinates is u(y,x). 
Also note,
the y coordinate increases in the downward direction. AS per MATLAB.
the x coordinate increases as we move towards right.

So imax---> no of INTERIOR grid points in y direction
jmax---> no of INTERIOR grid points in x direction
Note, that its a staggered grid.
posn of the cylinder ---> (x_c,y_c) it is placed at 0.55*L_x from the LEFT Boundary

The execution of the code starts from the main.m file.
 
Note, that the code follows PRESSURE CORRECTION METHOD for pressure velocity coupling as followed in Fractional Step Methods

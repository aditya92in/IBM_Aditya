code
Note, the computed C_d values and C_l values are for the top cylinder only. 
Whether they remain the same and how to compute them for different T/D will be updated soon.
In the results, only the velocity vectors are shown .
Vorticity needs to be plotted as well. In the video xlabel is x axis, y label is y axis.
Pressure needs to plotted, Velocity contours need to be plotted

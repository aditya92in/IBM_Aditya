 L_x= length of the domain in x direction
 L_y=length of the domain in y direction
-Note, that i use matlab convention. 
+Note, that i use matlab convention. so u(imax,jmax) in cartesian coordinates is u(y,x). 
+Also note,
+the y coordinate increases in the downward direction. AS per MATLAB.
+the x coordinate increases as we move towards right.
+
 So imax---> no of INTERIOR grid points in y direction
 jmax---> no of INTERIOR grid points in x direction
 Note, that its a staggered grid.

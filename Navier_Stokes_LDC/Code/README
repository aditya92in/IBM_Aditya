Note, this is the same Navier_Stokes Code for the flow between parallel plates for the Lid_Driven Cavity flow, 
subject to these boundary conditions

    There a few optimizations to do
    1. Make it consume less memory, which i have already done for the IBM VS case
    2. Implement it with Reynolds Number. Update will follow soon.

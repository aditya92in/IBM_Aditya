# Navier_Stokes_a1
This is my first start for coding the Navier Stokes Equations on a Staggered Grid. Most of the codes found in google are spaghetti, and very difficult to read for the noob. This repo thus, can be used as a starting point, (also for myself), and for the beginner. Having said that ,people who have already built their NS ,can also look for bugs in this code. This is a part of my thesis on IBM, for which the first step is building your own working,robust, NS Solver. Feel free to ping me at aditya92in@gmail.com

This is a finite Volume Navier Stokes code, which uses CDS for spatial gradients everywhere, and AB2 for time integration of the momentum and viscous terms. Like i said, this is a first start. Better schemes can be put into this. The code itself can be made implicit, and other stuff. All this, i hope to follow soon, if time permits, and my thesis schedules permit.
